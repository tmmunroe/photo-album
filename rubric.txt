"Instructions: Please add your name (UNI) and your team member’s name (UNI) under the preferred slot. 

Note: Please be ready to present your project 5 minutes before your demo slot. 
Since each slot is only 10 minutes, we urge you to make sure that all your AWS 
services are up and running BEFORE the demo, so that there are no delays.

This includes having your CloudFormation template ready (read below), 
front-end app open, several photos ready to be upload, etc. 

Please also be prepared to share your screen. 

PLEASE READ: 
    -   Cloudformation: You must start a deployment before your demo time 
        so that during the demo, we can verify if all the services are deployed
        correctly based on the template that you've used. 
    -   CodePipeline: We will be asking you to push a change to your frontend/backend
        repos during the demo to test if the changes trigger the pipeline and deploy 
        automatically. We recommend you are ready to show both your AWS console as 
        well as the web application hosted on the S3 bucket.
